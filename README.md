# Benedict

A Quartz Composer plugin to provide a procedurally-generated satisfying breakfast. Just input a color, and Benedict gives back menu description for a tasty Eggs Benedict. Need some text in your compositions? Want to brighten up a prototype? Just order the special: Benedict.

Put Benedict.plugin in /Library/Graphics/Quartz Composer Plug-Ins to add it to your library in Quartz Composer. Make sure to restart Quartz Composer after moving the plugin.
